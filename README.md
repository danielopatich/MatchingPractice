Daniel Opatich -
To begin running this project you'll need to do an npm install to obtain the
dependencies included in this project. If your node version is out of date the build may crash,
if that happens you can quickly switch between versions with node version manager (nvm).

Most of these dependencies are preloaded from react-create-app's boiler plate.
My project uses babel the most from those to compile ES6 syntax.

I have only added lodash for a few functions.

After a successful npm install, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
